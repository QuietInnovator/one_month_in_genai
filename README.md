# Plan
 to put everything together and to make a portfolio of my month in generative AI, I will follow the steps
 - Modularize the whole application, And this should happen interpret folders with separate testing so that I can see how it's going.
    - *note: Applications with many dependencies will be linked*
    -make sure to clean up the titles of each
    
 - Make sure that I have a story and to implement the story telling aspect and my master
   - Take it as a video on on Riverside
 - Optional: Deployed on Heroku and see how to get to abifadel.net.
