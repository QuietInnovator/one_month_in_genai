    it's great to see you here!
             
    I've been using genAI for a month now and I've learned a lot.
             
    I've used it for a lot of things, from summarizing meetings to writing research papers to generating taglines for my projects.

    Now tell me which one you liked the most and why?
             
    -----------
    Now is a good time to tell you about me.
    I'm a software engineer turned data scientist with a passion for getting things done.
